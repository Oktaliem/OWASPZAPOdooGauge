# OWASPZAPOdooGauge
Demo Automated Security/Penetration testing with OWASP ZAP + Selenium + TestNG + Gauge + Java + Maven + Odoo.
This repository has 2 ways to run the test :
- run it via TestNG framework
- run it via Gauge framework

Gauge is another alternative framework to write a test via specification without gerkhin langunge (i.e Cucumber/JBehave)

# Purpose
- This demo/repository is to provide example or framework/model that can be integrated in CICD QA-DevSecOps.
- Eveybody can check out from this repository, run in their own local and learn security/penetration testing as a proof of concept.

If you have any idea, suggestion or something that can be improved.
Nice to talk!! Sharing is caring. Let's learn together....
